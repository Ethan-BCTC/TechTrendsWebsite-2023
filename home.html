                <div1>
                    Electric Vehicles are vehicles that use an electric motor rather than an internal cumbustion engine like majority of vehicles. Electic vehicles rely on high amounts of electricity to be capeable to move such a high weight, to sovle this issue engineers developed a new type of battery that is made up of thousands of smaller lithium batterys. Litium batterys allow the vehicle to charge at an extreamly fast pace while retaining a large amount of that power.</div1>
                <h4 >How do Electric Vehicles benifit society?</h4>
                <div1>
                    The benefit of electric vehicles are their ability to lower the carbon footprint of transportation as well as lower vehicle fueling costs by half, or more.

                <h4 >What are some drawbacks of Electic Vehicles in society?</h4>
                <div1>
                    One drawback lithium battery production of such magnitude is very harmful to the environment and is very dangerous. Production can impact the environment in many ways such as decreasing biodiversity, increasing air polution, and decreasing freshwater supply in third world contrys. This id caused by the destruction of habitats, air pollution from the heavy machineary and crude mining methods of lithium.
